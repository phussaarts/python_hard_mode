# Awful Python

This Python script is bad. It works (more or less), but it's bad.
It violates almost every style convention in the book and abuses several dunder methods to achieve very confusing
results.

The reasons for making this monstrosity are:
1. To test my knowledge of Python by doing everything wrong on purpose.
2. To highlight the importance of style conventions and how confusing things become if you're to throw them out the
   window.
3. To illustrate how misusing magic/dunder methods can be outright dangerous to our sanity.

Apart from the very sensible reasons above this was also just a good bit of fun to do. You'll notice therefore that
everything was done in the most convoluted way possible.
